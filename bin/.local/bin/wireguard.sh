# WireGuard already ships with the wg-quick@.service unit, which is Â± exactly what you have in here. Thus, rather than instructing users to create a new unit, you may simple instruct them to systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0 and systemctl start wg-quick@wg0. The Ubuntu packages should be installing this automatically, and if you're compiling and installing manually, make install will automatically install this unit file too.
